# food-sourcing
Blockchain based application to get the origin and information of the food

Food-Sourcing consists of a web service, a phone application, and a database (hosted on the web service). A user scans the QR code on an item of food with their phone, the application uploads that code to the webservice. The webservice then checks the code against the codes stored in the database, and returns the associated information about the food’s origin, distributor, etc to the user’s phone.
